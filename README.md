- 👋 Hi all, I’m @rldevries (I will simply follow the format here!)
- 👀 I’m interested in software design, cybersecurity and new technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at the University of Ottawa through Canada's Coding for Veterans Program
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on any particular topic since this learning environment consumes vast amount of time
- 📫 How to reach me ... this is WIP for now.
